All 15 tasks pass. The final verification confirms:

- **`make build`** — produces `./mhist` binary
- **`make test`** — all 31 unit tests pass (9 buffer, 11 mouse, 11 protocol)
- **`make vet`** — no issues
- **`bash test_integration.sh`** — all 6 integration tests pass
- **`./mhist ls`** — exits 0, shows header with no sessions
- **`ALL_TASKS_COMPLETE`** — already written to `progress.md`
- **`tasks.json`** — all 15 tasks have `"passes": true`

The project is complete. mhist is a fully functional terminal multiplexer for mosh scrollback with:
- Session management (new, attach, ls, kill)
- PTY management with Unix socket IPC
- Binary wire protocol
- 10,000-line scrollback ring buffer
- Mouse wheel history scrolling
- Prefix key (Ctrl+a) for detach
- Window resize handling
- Session cleanup on shell exit
- Integration and unit test coverage
